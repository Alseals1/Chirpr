Chirper (Front End)
In this lab, you will be building your first front-end application using ReactJS.

It's called Chirper, a platform where you can post short messages on the internet for all the world -- even the Presidents of the United States -- to see!

Prerequisites
Watch the "Introduction to React" videos available to you at Covalence. Rewatch them where necessary.
Install Create React App on your local machine.
Use Create React App to create your first React application.
Install the React Developer Tools in Chrome.
Import Bootstrap 4 into your index.html file.
Instructions
Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

Your timeline should load with at least three chirps, and your users need the capability of posting new Chirps, which will be displayed back to them in the timeline once they are posted.

Design constraint: You can only invoke ReactDOM.render() one time in your entire application.

Getting Started
Familiarize yourself with your new React application, but quickly move into separating components into their own directory.
Remember: one component per file!

Convert your .js files into .jsx files.

Use only Bootstrap classes. You should not need any custom CSS in this project.

Think about the design of your project. How will you compose (or extract) components to achieve the desired result?

Happy Hacking!




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
